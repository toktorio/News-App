Simple news app that fetches data from [theguardian](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/) news open source API.

*This app is created as the eighth project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) program at Udacity.*

*This app uses the theguardian API but is not endorsed or certified by theguardian.*

### Features
- Get the latest technology news directly from theguardian news.
- Simple and stunning design that follows the Material design guidelines.

### What I have learned from this project
- Fetching data from an API using Android HttpURLConnection API.
- Using AsyncTaskLoader to load data efficiently in the background thread.
- Parsing a JSON response to get the required data for the model class.
- Creating a RecyclerView that contains the data and display it to the user.
- Handling error case and empty response gracefully.
